Understood 👍
You **updated `README.md` directly on GitHub**, and now you want **that updated README in your local project**.

This is very simple and safe.

---

## ✅ FASTEST & CORRECT WAY (Recommended)

### 🔹 Step 1: Go to your local repo

```bash
cd /d/path/to/swosti-assignment
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Pull only from GitHub

```bash
git pull origin master
```

✅ This will:

* Download the updated `README.md`
* Merge it into your local repo
* Keep all your local code intact (unless you changed README locally too)

---

## 🔎 If Git says **“Already up to date”**

That means:

* Your local README is already same
* Or your local branch is not tracking `origin/master`

Fix tracking:

```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master
git pull
```

---

## ⚠️ If you get a README conflict

This happens if:

* You also edited `README.md` locally

### Resolve manually:

```bash
git status
```

Open `README.md`, fix conflict markers:

```md
<<<<<<< HEAD
(local content)
=======
(GitHub content)
>>>>>>> origin/master
```

Then:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Resolve README update from GitHub"
```

---

## ✅ ADVANCED (Pull only README.md explicitly)

If you want **only README.md**, nothing else:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout origin/master -- README.md
```

Then:

```bash
git status
git commit -m "Update README from GitHub"
```

---

## 🧠 Best practice (for interviews)

After updating README:

```bash
git log --oneline --max-count=3
```

You should see:

```
xxxxxxx Initial commit - Swosti assignment submission
yyyyyyy Update README
```

Clean & professional ✅

If you want, next I can:

* 🔍 Review your README for interview quality
* ✍️ Improve wording (backend-focused, enterprise tone)
* 📌 Add “How reviewers should evaluate this project”

Just tell me 👍
