Got it 👍
You want **the GitHub repository**
👉 [https://github.com/saddamhdev/swosti-assignment](https://github.com/saddamhdev/swosti-assignment)
to be **completely replaced by another local project’s code** (same repo, new content).

Below are **safe + correct ways**, depending on your situation.

---

## ✅ **OPTION 1 (RECOMMENDED): Replace everything with another local project (force overwrite)**

Use this if:

* You **don’t care about old commits**
* You want GitHub to look **exactly like your local project**

### 🔹 Step 1: Backup (important)

```bash
cp -r swosti-assignment swosti-assignment-backup
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Copy your new local project INTO the repo folder

Example:

```bash
# Suppose your new project is here
D:/new-project/

# Repo is here
D:/swosti-assignment/

# Delete old code
rm -rf D:/swosti-assignment/*

# Copy new project code
cp -r D:/new-project/* D:/swosti-assignment/
```

⚠️ **Do NOT copy `.git` from the new project**

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Push forcefully

```bash
cd swosti-assignment

git status
git add .
git commit -m "Replace entire project with new implementation"
git push origin master --force
```

✅ **Result:**

* GitHub repo fully replaced
* Old history effectively ignored
* Interviewers see only the new project

---

## ✅ **OPTION 2: Keep commit history (clean but advanced)**

Use this if:

* You want a **professional commit trail**
* Old commits are irrelevant but still preserved

```bash
cd swosti-assignment

git rm -r .
cp -r ../new-project/* .

git add .
git commit -m "Refactor: replaced with new project structure"
git push origin master
```

---

## ✅ **OPTION 3: One-commit clean slate (BEST for interviews)**

This creates a **single clean commit**.

```bash
cd swosti-assignment

rm -rf .git
git init
git branch -M master
git remote add origin https://github.com/saddamhdev/swosti-assignment.git

cp -r ../new-project/* .

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Swosti Assignment"
git push -u origin master --force
```

🔥 **This is what senior engineers often do for assignments**

## 🔎 Which should YOU choose?

| Situation              | Best Option  |
| ---------------------- | ------------ |
| Interview assignment   | **Option 3** |

| Preserve repo history  | Option 2     |
