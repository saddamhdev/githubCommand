Perfect! Let’s explain **`git revert`**, which is different from `git reset` and much safer for shared repositories.

---

## 🔹 What is `git revert`?

`git revert` **undoes a commit by creating a new commit** that reverses the changes of a previous commit.

* **Important:** It does **not delete history**.
* This makes it **safe to use on branches that others are using**, unlike `git reset --hard`.

---

## 🔹 Syntax

```bash
git revert <commit>
```

Example:

```bash
git log --oneline
# 7e4b9d8 Added login feature
# 1f4a23b Fixed database bug

git revert 7e4b9d8
```

* Git creates a new commit that **undoes the changes** made in `7e4b9d8`.

---

## 🔹 Example Scenario

Repo history:

```
A -- B -- C (HEAD -> main)
```

* Commit **C** introduced a bug.
* Run:

```bash
git revert C
```

New history:

```
A -- B -- C -- D (HEAD -> main)
```

* Commit **D** reverses the changes of **C**.
* Notice that **C still exists** — it’s not deleted.

## 🔹 Difference from `git reset`

| Command                     | Effect                                         | Safe for shared branches? |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `git reset --hard <commit>` | Moves branch pointer, deletes commits after it | ❌ No, rewrites history    |
| `git revert <commit>`       | Creates a new commit that undoes changes       | ✅ Yes, safe               |

---

## 🔹 Why use `git revert`?

1. Undo mistakes **without rewriting history**.
2. Safely undo commits in **shared branches** like `main`.
3. Keep a **clear, auditable history**.

---

✅ **Summary**:

* `git revert` = “undo a commit safely by making a new commit.”
* Does **not remove the original commit**, unlike `git reset`.
* Always safe for shared/public branches.

If you want, I can make a **diagram showing `git revert` vs `git reset`** so you can see visually how they affect history differently.




In revert only commit text change or commit code also change?

Ah, this is a key point 👌

When you run **`git revert <commit>`**, Git **reverses the code changes of that commit**, not just the commit message.

---

### 🔹 How it works:

Suppose your repo:

```
A -- B -- C (HEAD -> main)
```

* **C** added a new function in `file.txt`.
* You run:

```bash
git revert C
```

Git will:

1. Look at what **C changed** compared to **B**.
2. Apply the **opposite of those changes** to your working directory.
3. Create a **new commit D** that effectively undoes C.

So after revert:

```
A -- B -- C -- D (HEAD -> main)
```

* **D** contains code changes that undo C.
* **C** still exists in history.
* The commit message of D will, by default, be something like:

```
Revert "Added new function"
```

---

### 🔹 Important points:

1. **Code changes are reversed.**

   * If C added a line, D removes it.
   * If C removed a line, D restores it.

2. **Commit history remains intact.**

   * Unlike `git reset`, which can delete commits, revert keeps all commits in the log.

3. **Commit message is new.**

   * Git automatically creates a new message like `Revert "<original message>"`.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* `git revert` changes the **code**, not just the text.
* Creates a new commit that **undoes the previous commit**.
* Original commit is still in history.

So revert meaning?


Exactly! Let’s put it clearly:

---

### 🔹 Git Revert Meaning

**`git revert` = “to undo a commit safely by creating a new commit that reverses the changes of the previous commit.”**

* It **does not delete history**.
* It **reverses the code changes** made in the original commit.
* A **new commit** is created with a message like:

  ```
  Revert "Original commit message"
  ```

---

### 🔹 Simple Analogy

* Imagine you wrote a paragraph in a shared document (commit).
* Later you decide it was wrong.
* Instead of erasing it (like reset), you **write another paragraph that cancels the first one**.
* Everyone can still see both the original paragraph and the “revert paragraph.”

---

### 🔹 Key points

1. Safe for shared/public branches.
2. Code changes are undone.
3. Commit history remains intact.
4. Useful for fixing mistakes **without rewriting history**.

If you want, I can also **explain the difference between `git revert` and `git reset` in one short sentence** so it’s easy to remember forever.

Do you want me to do that?



If you want, I can make a **small visual diagram showing original commit vs revert commit and code changes** so you can see exactly what happens.
